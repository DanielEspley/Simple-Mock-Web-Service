# Simple Mock Web Service #

**Simple Mock Web Service (SimpleMock)** provides RESTful web services, for mocking purpose, to be consumed in any JavaScript frameworks using AJAX call.


# Background #

**SimpleMock** is originally inspired by [node EasyMock](https://github.com/CyberAgent/node-easymock) managed by [Patrick Boos](https://github.com/pboos), which provides a web server, using `node.js`, for mocking web services. Instead of using `node.js`, **SimpleMock** does its features through ASP.NET Web API.
